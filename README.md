# PiShow

In this project I will be using the GPU_FFT library to do fast fourier transforms on the GPU of my Raspberry Pi 3. This will be used to process live audio via the Internet (which will also be played to a Bluetooth device) and generate volume data for individual key frequency bands. This data will drive an array of RGB Neopixel LED's housed in a geometric 3D structure I designed and 3D printed. This project is still in early development and prototyping.
